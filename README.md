# Intelligent Battery Management

**Intelligent Battery Management** is a project designed to predict the health of a battery based on various input parameters such as cycles, temperature, state of charge (SoC), average kilometers driven per day, and battery age. The project provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the battery management system.

## Features
- **Prediction Form**: Allows users to input battery-related parameters.
- **Health Prediction**: Predicts battery health based on the provided inputs.
- **Web Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use web-based interface for battery management.

## Usage

1. **Input Form:**
   - Fill out the form with the following parameters:
     - **Cycles**: Number of charge-discharge cycles.
     - **Temperature**: Operating temperature of the battery.
     - **State of Charge (SoC)**: Percentage of charge remaining in the battery.
     - **Average Kilometers Driven per Day**: Estimated average distance driven per day.
     - **Months Old**: Age of the battery in months.

2. **Prediction:**
   - Click the "Predict Battery Health" button to obtain the predicted battery health based on the input parameters.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priyanshuraj009/Intelligent-Battery-Management.git
    cd Intelligent-Battery-Management
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any).

3. **Run the application:**
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the prediction form.
